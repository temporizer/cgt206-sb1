<h2>Addiction?</h2>

<p>Can someone really be addicted to getting tattoos? 45 million Americans have at least one tattoo. Are they all addicted? And how do you determine when someone is addicted?</p>

<p>There has been a lot of talk in recent years about tattoo addiction. 32% of people with tattoos claim they have an addiction according to a 2013 Pew Research study. There is a rush of adrenaline involved in getting a tattoo. Many people who get tattoos go back for more. Is that enough for it to be an addiction? People that go in for their first tattoo sometimes make jokes about getting addicted. That left us wondering: Can someone be addicted to something they choose to do?</p>

<p>Why do people get tattoos? There are as many reasons as there are people. Some people get tattoos to identify with a group. Others get a tattoos to remember someone. For some it’s about the art. Occasionally people still get drunk and get a “regret” tattoo. Many people got their first tattoo because of peer pressure. Not one person we talked to said they got a tattoo because they are addicted to the pain or the rush they get while being tattooed. Of course our poll was limited to about 50 people, so maybe we didn’t find any addicts in our limited research.</p>
<p>Addiction isn’t a word that should be thrown around lightly. Genuine addiction is very serious and has long lasting consequences. We are not saying that some of the 45 million Americans that have tattoos couldn’t have an addiction involving tattooing. Just be careful if you’re going to use the word. Maybe use the word passion instead?</p>
<p>Tattooing is wildly popular now, but it’s not the first time. Before Christianity banned it, tattooing was found in nearly every culture. Archaeological evidence shows that early in human history tattoos were used for medicinal purposes. In some cultures anyone without tattoos was considered low-born. Other cultures tattooed their slaves and prisoners. Throughout history tattoos have been tied to religion too. Today people often have tattoos of religious symbols. Are people who get religious or cultural tattoos addicts?</p>
<p>On the other hand, some people do go back over and over to get tattoos and it’s not because they are from the Maori culture. What drives that behavior? Is there an number of tattoos a person can get before they are an addict?</p>
